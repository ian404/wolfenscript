wolfenscript
============

Remake of a "Wolfenstein"-type game (raycaster) using HTML5/javascript.  Done as a learning experience and intro to JS/game programming.

This is a work in progress - being developed on a low-spec pc and running on Chrome.  I haven't tested any other platforms, but shouldn't be a problem.

<b>Usage</b>

Copy all three files into the same location and open the html file.

Right now allit does is display some WebGL squares ... more to come.
